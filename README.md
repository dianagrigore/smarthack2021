## Who is our user?
Our target user is forgetful and definitely not a security expert, so our app should help him keep his passwords confidential, integral and available at all times. We should protect him from social engineering attacks. An average person has about 25 different online accounts, but only 54% of users use different passwords across their accounts and our user is not different so we should encourage him to hold multiple and different passwords across all his accounts.
